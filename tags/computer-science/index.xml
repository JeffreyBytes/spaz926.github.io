      <description>Day 4: I didn&amp;rsquo;t post anything yesterday because it was a very simple review day. Nothing too heavy to really discuss in a blog post. I reviewed the nine topics listed on Hacking with Swift, Swift Review, Day One (variables and constants, data types, operators, string interpolation, arrays, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, and switch cases).
I followed that up with a non-Swift review of methods, information hiding, and scope. I believe it is very important to not only understand Swift, but also to have an understanding of the computer science fundamentals.</description>
